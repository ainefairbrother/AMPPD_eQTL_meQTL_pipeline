    + Directory description: The pipeline used to generate the 'meth files' that are then bound using the script bind_meth_files_to_matrix.py was run on the Terra platform and is available at: https://portal.firecloud.org/?return=terra#methods/aine_fb_ucl/calculate_mismatch_proportion_workflow/14. The workflow was run on the 2020_v2release_1218/ release simply to cover more samples, and allow flexibility but the matrices can be filtered down to the 2019 sample set to be compatible with 2019-release -based analyses. 
    + Directory content: 
        + 01-bind_meth_files_to_matrix.py: this script runs om methylation matrices (1 file per sample, 1 row per file), these were transferred from the Terra platform using gsutils to the relevant server. The matrices were generated from AMP-PD BAM files using the following workflow: https://portal.firecloud.org/?return=terra#methods/aine_fb_ucl/calculate_mismatch_proportion_workflow/14
