    + Directory description: all scripts involved in the processing of AMP-PD genomic data (gvcf files)  
    + Directory content: The directory consists of scripts copied from and executable on Rosalind (01 through 08a), and scripts executable on the RytenLab server (08b, 09, 99). This set of scripts is a pipeline to go from raw AMP-PD .vcf.gz files separated by chromosome, to files usable for downstream analyses such as: variant filtered .vcf.gz files, cohort-level .vcf.gz files, split by case and control, in .bed format, in 012 genotype matrix format. 
         + 01-filter_vcf_files.sh: this script filters the vcf files for MAF > 1% --maf, missing data < 1% (0.01) --max-missing and HWE P>0.001 --hwe  
         + 01a-check_filtered_vcfs.sh: [INCOMPLETE] this script contains commands to check the number of samples, number of variants (lines) and the first 4 rows of specified columns  
         + 02-generate_cohort_sampleid_lists.sh: this script generates sample lists used to separate each chr vcf file by searching for sample IDs using their prefix, then storing them in .txt files  
         + 03-separate_vcf_chr_files_by_cohort.sh: this file uses the lists generated in 02 to filter each chr vcf file into three cohort files i.e. chrX > chrX_PD, chrX_PP, chrX_BF  
         + 04-concatenate_cohort_chr_vcfs.sh: combines all separate cohort chromosome files generated in 03 to generate one single cohort vcf file  
         + 04a-can filter for a maf>0.01 at this point using this script. This is currently hard-coded in this script as maf>0.05  
         + 05-make_bed_bim_from_vcf.sh: takes in single cohort file and generates 3 new files: bed, bim, fam. These are needed as .bed is the format for bigsnpr (to generate genetic PCs)  
         + 06-running-bigsnpr.R: runs the bigsnpr workflow to SNP thin, remove long-range LD and generate genetic PCs. The results of this are then visualised in the notebook ./notebooks/AMPPD-generating-gPCs.Rmd
         + 07-generate_geno_mat_from_vcf.sh  
         + 08a-wrangle_geno_mat_for_matrixeqtl.R: script to assign snp pos labels and sample ID labels to the 012 matrix, then split into cohort, case and control for downstream analyses  
         + At this stage, I transfered from Rosalind to RytenLab using the local bridge script: /Users/ainefairbrother/Desktop/rosalind2ryten.sh  
         + 08b-wrangle_geno_mat_for_matrixeqtl.R: this script formats the matrix for use in MatrixEQTL downstream  
         + 99-compress_and_index_vcfs.sh: this script is not numbered explicitly, as it was used at various stages of vcf processing - it is needed to bgzip and index vcfs
